## Why sugar?

Sugar consumption is believed to be related to insulin resistance, and
therefore all the western diseases (type ii diabetes, high blood
pressure, heart attack, cancer, gout, etc.)

There are different kinds of sugars. The fundamental ones are glucose,
fructose and galactose. These are called monosaccharides or simple
sugar. Disaccharide or double sugars are sugars that is composed of two
simple sugars. For example, sucrose (table sugar) can be decomposed to
glucose and fructose. Lactose can be decomposed to glucose and
galactose. Maltose can be decomposed to two glucose. Glucose can be used
as an energy source by almost every cell, while fructose and galactose
are mostly metabolized in liver.

It is found that fructose is especially likely to cause insulin
resistance. Since the table sugar is composed of one glucose and one
fructose, eating a lot of table sugar can greatly increase the risk of
insulin resistance and other western diseases.

This website showed the sugar content of 100 gram of fruits or candies.

I analyzed the data and showed the results on a image

(the few items on the bottom of the chart is still being worked out.
Obviously they have more frctose than 0.)
